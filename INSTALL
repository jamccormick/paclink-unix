Pre-installation requirements
=============================

sendmail
--------

sendmail must be installed.  You can download the latest revision of
sendmail from http://www.sendmail.org/ if you need it.  You will need
to manually configure a mailer for paclink-unix using wl2k.m4, so you
may need to install an optional package for sendmail configuration.
On Fedora Linux, you can install the package `sendmail-cf' using yum.

Once you have installed sendmail, the configure script for
paclink-unix should find and use it automatically if it is installed
on your PATH.  Otherwise, pass the full path to sendmail in the
SENDMAIL variable on the command line to the configure script for
paclink-unix, for example:
	./configure SENDMAIL=/usr/pkg/bin/sendmail

Berkeley DB
-----------

Berkeley DB library version 3 or greater must be installed.  You can
download the latest revision of version 4 from
http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db.html if you need it.  On
Fedora Linux, you can install the package `db4-devel' using yum.

They seem to have made it as difficult as possible to find the build
instructions in the latest release of bdb from Oracle.  To do a
standard install, you can try this:

cd build_unix
../dist/configure
make
make install

Once you have installed BDB, the configure script for paclink-unix
should find and use it automatically if you installed in the default
location.  If you specified a non-standard "--prefix=/your/bdb/path"
option when configuring BDB, you can tell paclink-unix its location at
build configuration time by specifying "--with-bdb-dir=/your/bdb/path"
when calling configure.

pkg-config
----------

pkg-config version 0.14 or greater must be installed.  You can
download the latest revision of pkg-config from
http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/ if you need it.  On Fedora Linux,
you can install the package `pkgconfig' using yum.

Once you have installed pkg-config, the configure script for
paclink-unix should find and use it automatically if it is installed
on your PATH.  Otherwise, pass the full path to pkg-config in the
PKG_CONFIG variable on the command line to the configure script for
paclink-unix, for example:
	./configure PKG_CONFIG=/usr/pkg/bin/pkg-config

glib
----

glib library version 2.10.3 or greater must be installed.  You can
download the latest revision of glib from ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/glib/
if you need it.  On Fedora Linux, you can install the package
`glib2-devel' using yum.

Once you have installed glib, the configure script for paclink-unix
should find and use it automatically via pkg-config.

gmime
-----

gmime library version 2.1.19 or greater must be installed.  You can
download the latest revision of gmime from
http://spruce.sourceforge.net/gmime/ if you need it.  On Fedora Linux,
you can install the package `gmime-devel' using yum.

Once you have installed gmime, the configure script for paclink-unix
should find and use it automatically via pkg-config.

autoconf
--------

You do not need autoconf for a normal build of paclink-unix releases.
It is required only if you are doing development work, building from
CVS, or if you need to modify the build infrastrucure for some reason.
The recommended version for paclink-unix development is 2.60 or newer.
You can download autoconf from http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
if you need it.  On Fedora Linux, you can install the package
`autoconf' using yum.

autoconf has other dependencies such as m4 and perl.  See README and
INSTALL in the autoconf distribution for details.

automake
--------

You do not need automake for a normal build of paclink-unix.  It is
required only if you are doing development work, building from CVS, or
if you need to modify the build infrastrucure for some reason.  The
recommended version for paclink-unix development is 1.96 or newer.
You can download automake from http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
if you need it.  On Fedora Linux, you can install the package
`automake' using yum.

Before installing automake you must first install autoconf.

ax25
----

Linux supports a native AX.25 network stack.  If the AX.25 headers are
detected at build time, paclink-unix will build a driver program
`wl2kax25'.  These headers are standard on some versions of Linux, and
optional on others.  On Fedora Linux, you can install the package
`libax25-devel' using yum.

Basic Installation
==================

These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
debugging `configure').

   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  (Caching is
disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
cache files.)

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You only need
`configure.ac' if you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using
a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a
time in the source code directory.  After you have installed the
package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring
for another architecture.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:

     OS KERNEL-OS

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the machine type.

   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.

Sharing Defaults
================

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Defining Variables
==================

Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).  Here is a another example:

     /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash

Here the `CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash' operand causes subsequent
configuration-related scripts to be executed by `/bin/bash'.

`configure' Invocation
======================

`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--with-bdb-dir=DIR'
     Look for Berkeley DB in directory DIR.  usually `configure' can
     determine that directory automatically.

`--disable-assert'
     Turn off assertions.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.

Completing the installation
===========================

sendmail customization
----------------------

You will need to customize sendmail to allow routing of outgoing mail
via Winlink 2000.  Copy wl2k.m4 into the sendmail mailer directory, add
this line to your sendmail.mc file:
	MAILER(wl2k)dnl
Then rebuild your sendmail.cf and restart sendmail.  You can then send
email to "callsign@wl2k" or "someone@somewhere.com.wl2k" to route via
the paclink-unix mail.wl2k mailer.

Permissions
-----------

The directories ${prefix}/var/wl2k and ${prefix}/var/wl2k/outbox
should be mode 0775.  The file ${prefix}/var/wl2k/mid.db should be
mode 0660.

All of the above can be owned by any user, preferably the primary
non-root userid who will be running the paclink-unix driver programs,
or by root.  The owner for these files can be set using the
--with-user=user configure option.

The same files should be owned by a group ID such as `mail'.  The
primary paclink-unix user should be a member of this group.  The
mailer system should also be set up to execute the local mailer
`mail.wl2k' running with this group ID.  The group can be set using
the --with-group=group configure option.
